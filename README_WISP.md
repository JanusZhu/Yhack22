Project Proposal
## Introduction
A travel app that suggests locations/activities based on uniqueness, affordability, and interests, not popularity. User crowdsourced. For the new generation.
Design:https://www.figma.com/file/tS703V5tb7pMyC08eS9Znk/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1

WHO
Features of our audience: A preference for authenticity, a dislike of the traditional “tourist trap” spots, a want for digital communal connection, and things under a budget.

WHY
“The younger generations are willing to skip overcrowded tourist destinations. They are always looking for hidden gems and undiscovered places. They feel better if they discover a new place before their friends do. Travel blogging started this trend. Influencers and bloggers began sharing their unique experience. As a result, people also wanted to have a story they can brag about.”

HOW
Membership based site
Your membership can rank up (i.e. number of locations shared etc.)
A tokenized system that allows you to make searches for certain locations.
One token upon entry. You must contribute to gain more tokens. Five tokens = one more accessible location
How is “not popular” decided?
The location doesn’t hit a certain number of Google searches in a certain time period.
How is affordable decided?
The location either is free or close to free.
How locations are added
We start with a base database of scraped locations that are “not popular”.
Users add or verify their own locations.
Location info includes name, location, and short description
Locations display
A liked percentage rating (hearts)
A uniqueness rating (flames)
Attached tags for interests (i.e. art, indie, peaceful, good for a date, etc.)



## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from our own experiences, our friend's experiences, and experiences we found online about traveling. We came to the conclusion that young adults of our generation are prioritizing different aspects of their travel experiences than what current tech tools help us find. A few aspects were a preference for authenticity, a dislike of overcrowded tourist spots, and the desire to find hidden gems.

## What it does
Wisp is a travel location information exchange and crowdsourcing app. Using a tokenized system, in exchange for sharing your own knowledge about your favorite local hidden gems, you gain access to search results from specific destinations. This limited exchange system aims to maintain the quality of the entries made to the app and foster a sense of community. 

## How we built it
Wisp is a web app built using React. 

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of how we were able to utilize our skills on this project in ways that complemented each other. We're a team that was formed last minute, with two of our team members participating remotely, and spanning 3 time zones and two continents. Thus, it honestly was a big accomplishment to even be able to put this project together. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot about what sort of pain points and issues we should consider when even coming up with a pitch. We all also definitely grew technically, growing familiar with React and integrating it with other back-end programs. 

## What's next for Wisp 
We are not sure what is next for Wisp, the project itself, but we are definitely carrying all the skills and assets we built for Wisp into our future projects!

Scenario: Someone wants to use this app to visit New Haven for 2 days. How will this app be useful and efficient to them? What does TripAdvisor or Yelp or Google not have that we can do?

Brainstorming / Potential Features
Geolocation-based search
It’s essentially a cleaned up and more efficiently coalesced blog?
Rating and ranking system for preset itineraries
A way for the user to create a customized itinerary based off of auto-suggestions
If this is too big and complex, reducing to a customizable itinerary tool that relies on auto-suggestions?
a real-time map with info next to itinerary
